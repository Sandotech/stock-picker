# Stock Picker

Practicing Ruby by The Odin Project's course, I've done this small project called `stock picker` that takes an array of stock prices (each price representing a day) and returning the best day to buy and the best day to sell.

```
cd /stock_picker
ruby main.rb
```

This run `lib/stock_picker.rb` and return the result. For example:

```
By this stock prices 17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10

return => [1, 4] # 3$ - 15$ = 12$ of profit
```
